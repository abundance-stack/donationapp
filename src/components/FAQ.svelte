      <p class="mt-2" transition:fade>Your donation is converted into cryptocurrency and securely stored in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This storage is the community currencies reserve, backing the credit tokens created to give to your donee. After a few minutes, your donee receives the currency tokens in their blockchain wallet and is able to spend them. Meanwhile you can track your donationâ€™s impact in your impact dashboard.</p>

      <p class="mt-2" transition:fade>Similar to how a central bank aims to keep a steady interest rate, Sarafu targets a reserve ratio of 25% reserve currency / community credit tokens. This means that there is a variable exchange rate between USD and the community currency. You can few the exchange rate in our exchange panel.</p>
